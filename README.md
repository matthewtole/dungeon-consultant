# Dungeon Manager

Build and run a dungeon to help support the local economy!

## Overview

**[Theme Hospital](https://www.gog.com/game/theme_hospital) meets [Dungeon Keeper](https://www.gog.com/game/dungeon_keeper)!**

Nobody is visiting your little village, so you've been asked to build an run a dungeon that will stimulate the local economy by attracting adventurers from all over the world!
You must balance the needs of your minions with the desires of the townfolk to keep people visiting. They want to steal your gold, and you want to make a profit.

## Status

This game is very much a work in progress. I am still learning Unity as well as general game design and pixel art. I hope to have a playable demo ready by the end of 2020.

## Designs

This is a mockup built in Tiled that represents the current direction of the game.
